# AST-BBST Foundations

## Overview

This first course is a basic introduction to black box testing. It presents basic terminology and considers:

* the mission of testing
* the oracle problem
* the measurement problem
* the impossibility of complete testing

More info on the Learning Objectives for Foundations of Software Testing are available on the BBST.info website.

Lecture 1: Overview & Basic Definitions

This provides an overview of the online Black Box Software Testing courses and introduces some definitions commonly used in the testing field.

* Lecture 1a \(10 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 1b \(10 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 1c \(9 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 2: Strategy

This considers why testers test, what they are trying to learn, and how they can organize their work to achieve their mission.

* Lecture 2a \(9 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 2b \(9 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 3: Oracles

This presents software oracles as heuristics that help testers make a judgment whether or not software passes the tests that are run.

* Lecture 3a \(7 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 3b \(10 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 3c \(7 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 4: Programming Fundamentals & Coverage

This presents information about basic data handling and storage to help testers think about the multi-dimensional problem of test coverage in more sophisticated ways.

* Lecture 4a \(10 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 4b \(9 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 4c \(9 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 4d \(4 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 5: The Impossibility of Complete Testing

This explores the complexity of determining when testing is finished and how the goal of complete testing is unattainable.

* Lecture 5a \(9 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 5b \(10 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 5c \(10 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 6: Introduction to Measurement

This addresses the challenges of measurement in software testing.

* Lecture 6a \(9 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 6b \(9 mins\) \(MP4\)
* Lecture 6c \(7 mins\) \(MP4\)
