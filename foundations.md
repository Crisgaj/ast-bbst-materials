# AST-Black Box Software Testing: Foundations

## Overview

This first course is a basic introduction to black box testing. It presents basic terminology and considers:

* the mission of testing
* the oracle problem
* the measurement problem
* the impossibility of complete testing

More info on the Learning Objectives for Foundations of Software Testing are available on the BBST.info website.

* [Lecture 1B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K5bz-Eqo4s&t=1s)
* [Lecture 1C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW6Tge48mnw)

### Lecture 2: Strategy

This considers why testers test, what they are trying to learn, and how they can organize their work to achieve their mission.

* [Lecture 2B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz7vmO3qD1o)

### Lecture 3: Oracles

This presents software oracles as heuristics that help testers make a judgment whether or not software passes the tests that are run.

* [Lecture 3C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nO4zSeRYpk)

### Lecture 4: Programming Fundamentals & Coverage

This presents information about basic data handling and storage to help testers think about the multi-dimensional problem of test coverage in more sophisticated ways.

* [Lecture 4A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB0qFevqrac)
* [Lecture 4B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20L-BHPfWUQ)

* [Lecture 4D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ233xzyY0A)

### Lecture 5: The Impossibility of Complete Testing

This explores the complexity of determining when testing is finished and how the goal of complete testing is unattainable.
