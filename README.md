# Welcome to the AST's Black Box Software Testing Materials

This site provides instructional materials (slides and videos) used for AST-Black Box Software Testing by the [Association for Software Testing](https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/courses)'s own courses. All materials including updates made by the AST are [Creative Commons-licensed](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). 

These materials were pulled from the open source, creative commons licensed BBST® material at [The Center for Software Testing Education & Research](http://testingeducation.org/BBST/). The AST no longer uses the trademarked BBST® term but where applicable we note that BBST® is a registered trademark of [Altom Consulting](https://altom.com/). (If you find this term used in our materials please [file a bug](https://github.com/associationforsoftwaretesting/ast-bbst-materials/issues).)


Note: *This site is very much a work in progress*

### Goals

The goals of this project are simple:

1. Host updated materials used in our classes
2. Eventually provide self-study options
3. Create a backup of those public files in case www.testingeducation.org/BBST becomes unavailabile in the future. 

### Contributing

We'd love to get your input on improvements, suggestions, grammar, outdated concepts or any other bugs that you find. You can [file bugs here](https://github.com/associationforsoftwaretesting/ast-bbst-materials/issues) and then we will address them.
