# AST-BBST Test Design

Pulled directly from [TestingEducation.org](http://testingeducation.org/BBST/testdesign/):

## Overview

This course is a survey of test techniques. We look at a few techniques more closely than the rest but we don't expect this course to make you a skilled practitioner of any technique.

* Gain familiarity with a variety of test techniques.
* Learn structures for comparing objectives and strengths of different test techniques.
* Use the Heuristic Test Strategy Model for test planning and design.
* Use concept mapping tools for test planning.

The course takes a fast skim of several dozen techniques, and looks at a few in detail.

The current slide set comes in the course sequence after sections on:

* Function testing
* Domain testing (and with it, a first look at risk-based testing)
* Scenario testing

We then skim a group of 10 different techniques, noticing their different objectives, strengths and blind spots.
