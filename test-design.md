# AST-BBST Test Design

Pulled directly from [TestingEducation.org](http://testingeducation.org/BBST/testdesign/):

## Overview

This course is a survey of test techniques. We look at a few techniques more closely than the rest but we don't expect this course to make you a skilled practitioner of any technique.

* Gain familiarity with a variety of test techniques.
* Learn structures for comparing objectives and strengths of different test techniques.
* Use the Heuristic Test Strategy Model for test planning and design.
* Use concept mapping tools for test planning.

The course takes a fast skim of several dozen techniques, and looks at a few in detail.

The current slide set comes in the course sequence after sections on:

* Function testing
* Domain testing (and with it, a first look at risk-based testing)
* Scenario testing

We then skim a group of 10 different techniques, noticing their different objectives, strengths and blind spots.

### Lecture 1: Function Testing, Tours, & A Taxonomy of Techniques

This lecture provides a structure for organizing your thinking about the many test techniques, and a focus on testing tours and on function testing. (Why together? The most common tour is an excellent foundation for function testing.)

* part A (9 mins, 14 secs) 
* part B (9 mins, 20 secs) 
* part C (3 mins, 32 secs) 
* part D (10 mins) 
* part E (9 mins, 51 secs) 
* part F (4 mins, 38 secs) 

### Lecture 2: Risk-Based Testing, Testing Strategy and the Heuristic Test Strategy Model

This lecture introduces risk-based testing, including failure mode analysis and quicktests. The lecture also examines a few concepts important for developing a testing strategy.

* part A (9 mins,4 secs) 
* part B (9 mins,59 secs) 
* part C (9 mins, 15 secs) 
* part D (9 mins, 11 secs) 
* part E (1 mins, 39 secs) 

### Lecture 3: Specification-Based Testing

This lecture introduces specification-based testing and suggests eight questions that can guide specifications analysis.

* part A (8 mins, 24 secs) 
* part B (9 mins, 35 secs) 
* part C (9 mins, 1 sec) 

### Lecture 4: Scenarios and Use Cases. Comparatively Evaluating Test Techniques

This lecture introduces scenario testing, including 17 approaches to creating suites of scenario tests. It also suggests comparing test techniques in terms of their core strengths and describes 18 potential core strengths.

* part A (9 mins, 49 secs) 
* part B (9 mins, 49 secs) 
* part C (9 mins, 58 secs) 
* part D (10 mins) 

### Lecture 5: Domain Testing

This lecture introduces domain testing, the most popular test technique. The lecture presents a schema for applying domain testing that emphasizes the technique's roots in risk-based testing.

* part A (9 mins,26 secs) 
* part B (9 mins, 16 secs) 
* part C (9 mins, 57 secs) 
* part D (6 mins, 50 secs) 
* part E (9 mins, 57 secs) 

### Lecture 6: Combination Testing

This lecture focuses on ways to test several variables together, emphasizing combinatorial approaches (such as all-pairs).

* part A (7 mins, 20 secs) 
* part B (7 mins, 17 secs) 
* part C (9 mins, 49 secs) 
* part D (9 mins, 6 secs)
